## What is Runbook?

[Runbook](https://runbook.io) is an open source infrastructure monitoring service that allows you to perform automated "Reactions" when issues are detected. Runbook gives you the ability to automatically resolve DevOps alerts with zero human interaction.

Simply put, Runbook is what you would get if Nagios and IFTTT had a baby.
